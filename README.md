# GitHub User Search

GitHub User Search is a simple web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles by username and view detailed user information.
This is the project that I did when I just started learning web development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

The application includes error handling for the case where the user is not found on GitHub. When a user is not found, it displays an error message "User not found."
